### Endless Tetris: The Endless Challenge of Classic Blocks

**Welcome to Endless Tetris!** This is a modern remake of the classic Tetris game, designed specifically for players who love challenging themselves. Unlike traditional level-based modes, this version features **endless mode**—blocks will keep falling endlessly until your stack reaches the top and the game ends. Your goal is to stack blocks, clear full lines, accumulate high scores, and break your own records! The game is easy to pick up, but becoming a master requires skill, strategy, and a bit of luck.

#### Basic Gameplay
- **Block Falling**: Randomly shaped blocks (Tetrominoes) slowly descend from the top. You can move and rotate them to fit perfectly at the bottom.
- **Line Clearing**: When a row is completely filled, it disappears, and you earn points. The more lines cleared at once, the higher the score!
- **Game Over**: If the blocks stack up to the top, you lose. Restart the game and continue challenging for higher scores.

The game speed increases as your level rises (level up for every certain number of lines cleared), giving you an increasingly tense rhythm. Don't worry—beginners can easily get into it, starting slow and gradually adapting.

#### Unique Features
This Tetris version incorporates modern elements to make the game more exciting:
- **T-Spin Rotation Techniques**: Use the T-shaped block for special rotations to clear more lines and gain extra points. Supports "Mini T-Spin" and "Full T-Spin"—essential for pros!

A two-block-wide high slanted hole can also produce T1 and T2. Simply rotate once directly above the hole entrance and wait for it to fall naturally. It's recommended to do this when the falling speed is so fast that you can't react in time.
- **Back-to-Back (B2B) Rewards**: Perform consecutive high-difficulty clears (like quad lines or T-Spins), and your score multiplies by 1.5x, while accumulating B2B combo counts.
- **Perfect Clear**: Clear the entire screen at once? That's a big reward! The game will flash in celebration and record your PC count.
- **Hold Function**: Don't like the current block? Press Hold to store it temporarily and use it later. Full of strategic depth!
- **Preview Queue**: See the next 5 blocks, allowing you to plan your layout in advance.
- **High Score Record System**: Tracks your highest score, highest level, longest combo (Combo), longest B2B, and most PCs. Reset records anytime to challenge yourself!
- **Visuals and Sounds**: Blocks feature cool animated gradient effects, accompanied by pleasant sound effects during clears (combo pitches rise, B2B has special melodies). Supports on-screen buttons and keyboard controls, suitable for phones or computers.
- **Infinite Replayability**: No level limits, pure endless mode. Every game is a fresh start, with random block bags ensuring fairness.

#### Controls
- **On-Screen Buttons**: Use mouse or touch to click corresponding buttons (Hold, rotate, move, drop). Perfectly adapted for mobile devices!
